# Put this file in /etc/udev/hwdb.d/ and run systemd-hwdb update before plugging in your device.

# The lookup keys are composed in 80-ratbag.rules
#
# After changing entries in this file (or installing a new version of this
# file) run: sudo systemd-hwdb update
# Then unplug your device and plug it back in again.
#
# To add local entries for testing, create a new file
#   /etc/udev/hwdb.d/81-ratbag-local.hwdb
# and add a rule there. Look at the modalias file for your device
#   /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw0/device/modalias
# for the string we match against. That string contains three keys that matter:
# 'b' is the zero-prefixed 4-digit uppercase hex bus type (3 for usb or 5 for bluetooth)
# 'v' for the zero-prefixed 8-digit uppercase hex vendor id
# 'p' for the zero-prefixed 8-digit uppercase hex product id
#
# Ignore the 'g' key, use "g*" in the hwd entry.
